# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data

In this project, I  used data collected from the accelerometer and gyroscope of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone to prepare a tidy dataset that is easy to access and understand.

This repository contains the following files:

**README.md** this file provides an overview of the data set and how it was created.

**final_data.txt** this file contains the final tidy data set.

**CodeBook.md** this is the code book, which describes the contents of the data set

**run_analysis.R** this is the R script that was used to create the data set
