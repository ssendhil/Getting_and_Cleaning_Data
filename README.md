# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data

In this project, I  used data collected from the accelerometer and gyroscope of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone to prepare a tidy dataset that is easy to access and understand.

This repository contains the following files:

README.md, this file, which provides an overview of the data set and how it was created.
tidy_data.txt, which contains the data set.
CodeBook.md, the code book, which describes the contents of the data set (data, variables and transformations used to generate the data).
run_analysis.R, the R script that was used to create the data set
