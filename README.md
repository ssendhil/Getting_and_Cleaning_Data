# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data

In this project, I  used data collected from the accelerometer and gyroscope of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone to prepare a tidy dataset that is easy to access and understand.

This repository contains the following files:

- `README.md` 
  This file provides an overview of the data set and how it was created.

- `tidy_data.txt` 
  This file contains the final tidy data set.

- `CodeBook.md` 
  This is the code book, which describes the contents of the data set

- `run_analysis.R` 
  This is the R script that was used to create the data set
